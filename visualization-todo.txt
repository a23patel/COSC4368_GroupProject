# TODO list
# 1. Agree on LARGE window dimensions - DONE
# 2. Resize assets such that busiest cell fits all assets - DONE
# 3. Define all locations - dont need this i think
# 4. Write a function to show intial state
    # 1. white window - done
    # 2. blit zlevels side by side & perhaps label them (z=1, z=2, z=3) - Abraar can add this
    # 3. blit every asset to the appropriate postion - DONE
# 5. Incorporate action lists into the logic
# 6. Check terminal state reached, and reset (dropoffCounter == 20)
# 7. Display someting to indicate end of experiment

# maybe a more elegant solution to movement logic is:
# if aciton != U or D then
    # add or substract appropriate length (number of pixels) to x or y
# else if action == U or D then
    # if statements to perform large change in x coordinates (y never changes)
